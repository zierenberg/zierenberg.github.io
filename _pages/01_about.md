I am a theoretical physicist now in Neuroscience. Amongs others, I am
interested in 
* phase transitions and critical phenomena,
* criticality in neural networks,
* effect of disorder and correlations, 
* the analogy between particle condensation and polymer aggregation
* and what comes along the way

Short course of scientific life:
I studied physics in Leipzig and Zürich before doing a phd in Prof. Wolfhard
Jankes group in Leipzig. Now I am a postdoctoral researcher in Viola
Priesemann's group in Göttingen.
